# TechSoc Site Development

Jekyll is essentially a parsing engine, not a CMS. but it's better. Read the "Jekyll Introduction" on the home page, you'll find it under "Sample Posts" when you're running the site locally

To edit **styles**: got to `assets/themes/techsoc/css/style.css`, NOT `_site/assets.../style.css`, this is where the site is stored after parsing.

To edit **HTML**: it's `_includes/themes/techsoc/`. `default.html` for all general html, `page.html` for content of pages, and `post.html` for content of posts. Editing here changes all pages/posts, thank da Lord.

Branding images have been stored in `assets/themes/techsoc/images`.

Note: `{{ ASSET_PATH }}` refers to `assets/themes/THEME_NAME`, so don't add that in again please, but straight to the subfile of `techsoc`.


## Installing Jekyll and Running the Site Locally

Make sure you only have one version of ruby. You also need [RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) and [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download).

Use Rubygems to install jekyll: `gem install jekyll`, you can do this in your home directory.

cd to your GitHub folder, and go `jekyll serve` to see it hosted locally. Yes, you can change the code at the same time.


###Â Plug-ins

Other than [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/components/), I've plugged in [jQuery](http://api.jquery.com/). Consider [d3.js](http://d3js.org/).


#### Analytics & Comments

Analytics & comments have been installed and can be configured in configs `_config.yml`.

Original Author/Maintained at https://github.com/plusjade/jekyllbootstrap.com


## Version

0.3.0 - stable and versioned using [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

**NOTE:** 0.3.0 introduces a new theme which is not backwards compatible in the sense it won't _look_ like the old version.
However, the actual API has not changed at all.
You might want to run 0.3.0 in a branch to make sure you are ok with the theme design changes.
