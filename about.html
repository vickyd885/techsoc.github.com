	<h2>What Is TechSoc?</h2>
		<h3>An Accessible Network</h3>
		<p>	
			TechSoc creates a network that bridges the gap between studentsâ€™ ambitions and potential careers; connecting them to those in the industry and to each other.
		</p>
		<h3>A Platform for Encouragement</h3>
		<p>
			Our society is also a platform for the development of technical skills; engaging those new to technology and encouraging those that love it.
		</p>
		<h3>We Bridge the Gap</h3>
		<p>
			In line with our goals to make the tech industry accessible to students with diverse backgrounds, we make a conscious effort to collaborate with other societies to raise awareness of the vast range of opportunities available to them.
