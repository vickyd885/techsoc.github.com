			Our society is also a platform for the development of technical skills; engaging those new to technology and encouraging those that love it.

		<h3>A </h3>

			In line with our goals to make the tech industry accessible to students with diverse backgrounds, we make a conscious effort to collaborate with other societies to raise awareness of the vast range of opportunities available to them.
